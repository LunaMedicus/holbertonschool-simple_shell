hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple command language interpreter that executes commands read from
standard input.

In interactive mode,
.B hsh
prints a prompt, reads a command line, parses it, and executes it.
In non-interactive mode, it reads commands from piped input or a file.

The shell executes external programs by searching directories listed in
the
.B PATH
environment variable.
.SH BUILTINS

.B exit
Exit the shell. Can optionally receive an exit status.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, commands return status code 0. On failure, non-zero status codes
are returned. The shell keeps running until an
.B exit
command or end-of-file is encountered.
